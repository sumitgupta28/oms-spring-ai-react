# When to Use This Skill

**Proactively use this skill after:**
- Creating new mermaid diagrams in markdown files
- Editing existing mermaid diagrams
- User asks to validate/check mermaid diagrams

**Always validate before completing the task.**

# Instructions

1. Read the markdown file (use the file from context or ask user which file to validate)
2. **Run validation** using: `mmdc -i <file-path> -o /tmp/mermaid-validation.svg 2>&1`
3. **Report validation results**:
    - If valid: Confirm the diagram is valid and exit
    - If invalid: Show the errors found and explain what's wrong
4. **Fix the issues** automatically (invalid diagrams have no value)
5. **Re-validate** to confirm the fix worked
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until there are no validation issues
